===================================================
Welcome to the Hot-Cold Guess game, copyright 2020.
---------------------------------------------------

These are the game rules:
    * I’ll choose a random number in [1,50]. Your job is to guess that number.
    * From the second guess onward, I’ll tell you if your guess
      is hot (closer than the previous guess) or cold (farther from
      the previous guess).
    * If you wish to quit the game, just type in a negative number.

Good luck!
